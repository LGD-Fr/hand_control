abstract = {This paper presents a performance analysis of two open-source, laser scanner-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques (i.e., Gmapping and Hector SLAM) using a Microsoft Kinect to replace the laser sensor. Furthermore, the paper proposes a new system integration approach whereby a Linux virtual machine is used to run the open source SLAM algorithms. The experiments were conducted in two different environments; a small room with no features and a typical office corridor with desks and chairs. Using the data logged from real-time experiments, each SLAM technique was simulated and tested with different parameter settings. The results show that the system is able to achieve real time SLAM operation. The system implementation offers a simple and reliable way to compare the performance of Windows-based SLAM algorithm with the algorithms typically implemented in a Robot Operating System (ROS). The results also indicate that certain modifications to the default laser scanner-based parameters are able to improve the map accuracy. However, the limited field of view and range of Kinect's depth sensor often causes the map to be inaccurate, especially in featureless areas, therefore the Kinect sensor is not a direct replacement for a laser scanner, but rather offers a feasible alternative for 2D SLAM tasks.},

    abstract = {The Microsoft X-Box Kinect Sensor is a revolutionary new depth camera that is used in the gaming industry to capture motions of people and players efficiently using the technology of an RGB camera and infrared camera to differentiate depth. In the Microsoft X-Box, Kinect was used to sense 3D perception of human's motions. It can also be used for robotic applications, precisely for indoor navigation through the process of reverse engineering. Certain software packages were made available and are open source from &ldquo;LibFreenect&rdquo; for Linux machines, Microsoft's Kinect SDK using the Kinect namespace on Visual Studio 2010 Express (C++ or Visual Basic), and Google's released &ldquo;Robotic Operating System (ROS)&rdquo;. In order to claim that this sensor is capable of taking on such a task, we must be able to investigate thoroughly all factors that contribute to this and at the same time we must be able to understand its limitations to be applied and integrated properly with certain types of robots for accomplishing our purpose of achieving successful indoor navigation using proper algorithms. In this paper, the results from testing the Kinect sensor on an autonomous ground vehicle was given.},

This paper presents a method to recognize 3D human postures by using Microsoft Kinect sensor. Kinect is used as a capturing device. Capturing 3D human features mainly uses depth images obtained from Kinect sensor. Each pixel of depth images contains three-dimensional coordinate information of camera's scenes. Finally, the captured 3D human postures can be displayed by employing a human skeletal joints model and using a LED cube.},
